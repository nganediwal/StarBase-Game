# StarBase-Game

This is a simulation I made to visualize a docking/holding space for incoming starships giving the user the ability to select from different starship types and give it a name. Then there is a checking button to see if there is an available port to dock the starship. There are a few additional functionalities as well, with a clear button to clear all the docked starships from the ports.

A special emphasis is also given to display and appropriate GUI design, for example it is clearly stated which docks are empty or in use with multiple colors to depict it as well. Enjoy!
